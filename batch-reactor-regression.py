# # Regression: a reversible reaction in a batch reactor
#
# **CHME 5137, homework after Lectures 12 and 13 (October 20 and 23, 2026).** Section 5 of
# the Lecture 13 notebook started this. Here it is in full.
#
# *Written for 2026 by Claude Code (Claude Opus 5.5) from Prof. West's A ⇌ B fitting
# exercise of earlier years, and checked by Prof. West.*
#
# ---
#
# You run a reversible, first-order reaction in a batch reactor:
# $$\mathrm{A} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{B}, \qquad
# \frac{dC_A}{dt} = k_r C_B - k_f C_A, \qquad C_B = C_{A,0} - C_A$$
# Every run starts with $C_{A,0} = 10$ mol/L and no B. You measured $C_A$ every 10 s for
# 100 s, at three temperatures.
#
# **Kinetics.** The forward rate constant follows the Arrhenius expression,
# $k_f = A \exp(-E_a/RT)$.
#
# **Thermodynamics.** At equilibrium the forward and reverse rates are equal, so the
# equilibrium constant is $K = k_f/k_r$. (Assume an ideal solution, so this
# concentration-based $K$ is the thermodynamic one.) From thermodynamics,
# $$\Delta G^\circ = -RT\ln K \qquad\text{and}\qquad \Delta G^\circ = \Delta H - T\,\Delta S$$
# A and B have very similar heat capacities, so take $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ to be
# independent of temperature. Then $k_r = k_f/K$, and the whole model has **four
# parameters**: $\log_{10} A$, $E_a$, $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$.
#
# Before the experiments, from the literature and a quantum chemistry calculation, your
# estimates were $\log_{10}A \approx 6$ (A in s⁻¹), $E_a \approx 45$ kJ/mol,
# $\Delta H \approx -10$ kJ/mol and $\Delta S \approx -50$ J/mol/K. Let's see what the data say.
#
# ### How to work
#
# - **Commit as you go.** After each numbered task works, Restart & Run All, then commit
#   with a message that says what you did, and push. At least one commit per task.
#   **Commit the `.ipynb` and its paired `.py` together.**
# - **Answer the questions in words**, in the markdown cells marked *Answer*.
# - **Say what your ± means.** One standard error, or a 95% interval? Either is fine. Say which (Lecture 13).
# - **Let bugs shout.** If `solve_ivp` fails, `raise` an error with its `message`.
#   Don't let a half-finished solution reach `curve_fit` without anyone noticing.

# **(a) The model.** Write `cA_model(times, kf, kr)`, which solves the ODE with
# `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` and returns $C_A$ at `times` (use `t_eval`). In Lecture 13 we fitted
# functions that were a formula. `curve_fit` doesn't care: any function that takes the
# independent variable first and then the parameters, and returns predictions, will do. Even
# one that runs a whole simulation.
#
# Then **test it** (Lecture 11). This ODE has an exact solution,
# $$C_A(t) = C_{A,\mathrm{eq}} + (C_{A,0} - C_{A,\mathrm{eq}})\,e^{-(k_f+k_r)t},
# \qquad C_{A,\mathrm{eq}} = C_{A,0}\frac{k_r}{k_f+k_r}$$
# Check that your function agrees with it, for some reasonable $k_f$ and $k_r$, with an
# `assert`. (We use `solve_ivp` anyway because your project's model won't have an exact
# solution.)

# I. kf = 0.0168 +/- 0.0008 and kr = 0.0201 +/- 0.0015
# II. When p0 wasnt geussed the default answer was way off where...
# kf = 237.2838 +/- 32016.3111
# kr = 429.1295 +/- 57893.3634
# ... it did end up working however.
#
# III. THe starting guess was derived the same way you would get a time constant from like a newtons law of cooling problem with interesting logic. First you wanted to figure out the half way point was which you get from looking at what happens to when C_A is at equilibirum. I just said 5.5 as it seemed when C_A continued in the data that it bounced between 5.4 and 5.6. Reason why this is important is because the half way point between 5.5 and 10 is interpolated to calculate the t 1/2 so the I can isolate the sum of kf and kr. Then I used the second equation and reasange to find out that the sum of kf and kr multiplied against CA_EQ and CA_0 is equal to kf. Then just use the sum to find out kr. This gives you a really great aprroximate geuss.

# ## 2. Three temperatures, in two steps
#
# **(a)** Fit $k_f$ and $k_r$ separately at each temperature, and make a small table of
# $k_f$, $k_r$ (each with its ±) and $K = k_f/k_r$.
#
# **Before fitting anything else:** from your $K$ values alone, is the reaction endothermic
# or exothermic? How can you tell?

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# **(b) Arrhenius.** As in Lecture 13: `scipy.stats.linregress` on $\ln k_f$ against
# $1/T$ gives $E_a$ from the slope and $\ln A$ from the intercept. Convert $\ln A$ to
# $\log_{10} A$.
#
# **(c) van 't Hoff.** Put the two expressions for $\Delta G^\circ$ together and divide by $-RT$:
# $$\ln K = -\frac{\Delta H}{R}\,\frac{1}{T} + \frac{\Delta S}{R}$$
# So $\ln K$ against $1/T$ is a straight line too, with slope $-\Delta H/R$ and intercept
# $\Delta S/R$. Fit it, and get $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$, with their ±. Does the sign of
# $\Delta H$ agree with what you said in (a)?

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# **(d)** `linregress` gave you a ± on each of these. What does that ± know about,
# and what has it left out? Think about how many points each straight line had, and about
# the ± you got in (a).

# ## 3. All the data at once
#
# Step 2 fitted 3 × 2 rate constants, then fitted lines through three points each. Better:
# fit the four parameters you actually want **directly to all 30 measurements**, so that
# every measurement counts and the uncertainties carry all the way through.
#
# `curve_fit` wants one `xdata` and one `ydata`. With several experiments, stack them:
# `ydata` is all 30 concentrations in one array, and `xdata` carries **both** the
# temperature and the time of each one. `curve_fit` never looks inside `xdata`; it just passes it
# to your function. So it can be a tuple of two arrays:

# %%
T_all = np.repeat(temperatures, len(times))     # 298.15 ten times, then 308.15 ten times, ...
t_all = np.tile(times, len(temperatures))        # 10, 20, ..., 100, three times over
cA_all = np.concatenate([cA_data[T] for T in temperatures])
x_all = (T_all, t_all)
print(T_all[:12], t_all[:12], cA_all[:12], sep='\n')


# %% [markdown]
# **(a)** Write `cA_model_all(x, log10A, Ea, dH, dS)`. Unpack `x` into temperatures and
# times. For each temperature, work out $k_f$, $K$ and $k_r$, then call your `cA_model` for
# that temperature's times, and put the results in the right places of the output array.
# Solve one ODE per temperature, not one per data point. A boolean mask such as
# `T_col == T` picks out the rows.
#
# Notice the **units**: $E_a$ and $\Delta H$ in kJ/mol, $\Delta S$ in J/mol/K, and $A$ as
# $\log_{10}A$. That keeps all four parameters between about 1 and 100. An optimizer
# has an easier time when its parameters are all a similar size than when one is
# $10^{9}$ and another is $10^{-2}$. So convert carefully inside the function.
#
# Then fit it, **starting from your answers to task 2**, and report the four parameters with
# their ±.

# %%
def cA_model_all(x, log10A, Ea, dH, dS):
    """C_A (mol/L) for every (T, t) pair in x. Ea and dH in kJ/mol, dS in J/mol/K."""
    T_col, t_col = x

# **(b)** Now start from your estimates from before the experiments instead (6, 45, −10, −50).
# Does it find the same answer? How far did the data move you from what you expected?

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# **(c)** Compare with task 2. Are the centres the same? Are the error bars? Which set of
# error bars would you believe, and why?
#
# **(d) The correlation matrix.** The off-diagonal elements of `pcov` say how the errors in
# the parameters go together (Lecture 13). Turn the covariance into correlations:
# `pcov / np.outer(perr, perr)`. Which pairs are strongly correlated? Why those pairs?
# (Think about Lecture 13's ridge, and about the range of temperatures you measured over.)
# If someone quotes only your four ± values, what are they missing?

# ## 4. Look at the residuals
#
# **Always look at the residuals** (Lecture 13). Plot the residuals of the task 3 fit against
# time, one colour per temperature, with a line at zero.
#
# - Do you see a pattern, or does it look like noise?
# - Is the scatter about the same width at all three temperatures? Least squares assumed it is.
# - Nobody told you the measurement uncertainty, so `curve_fit` (with
#   `absolute_sigma=False`, the default) estimated it from the scatter of the residuals.
#   Work out that estimate yourself:
#   $s = \sqrt{\sum_i r_i^2 / (N - p)}$, with $N$ data points and $p$ parameters. What does
#   it say about how precisely $C_A$ was measured?
# - Suppose the experimentalist now tells you their instrument is good to ±0.01 mol/L.
#   What would that tell you about your model, or about the experiment?

# ## 5. Your project
#
# One paragraph. Which parameters in your project's model will come from fitting data, and
# where will the data come from: your own simulations, the literature, a research group? What
# can you say about the errors in those data? Are they the same absolute size, the same
# relative size, or known point by point? And are any of your parameters likely to be
# correlated, the way $E_a$ and $A$ are here?

# %% [markdown]
# *Answer:*

# %% [markdown]
# ## Stretch problems (optional)
#
# **(a) Untangle the ridge.** Write $k_f$ in terms of its value at a reference temperature in
# the middle of your data, say $T_\mathrm{ref} = 310$ K:
# $$k_f(T) = k_\mathrm{ref}\exp\left[-\frac{E_a}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_\mathrm{ref}}\right)\right]$$
# It's the same model, written differently. Fit $\log_{10}k_\mathrm{ref}$, $E_a$, $\Delta H$
# and $\Delta S$, and look at the correlation matrix again. What changed, and why? Can you do
# the same for $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$?
#
# **(b) Draw the posterior.** At 298.15 K only, put $k_f$ and $k_r$ on a 2-D grid and draw
# their posterior, as in Lecture 13, part 5, with a flat prior and Gaussian errors of width
# $s$ from task 4. Do its 95% credible intervals (summed over the other parameter) agree with
# `curve_fit`'s 95% confidence intervals? Why should they, or why not?
